# DeepLearningClass

Class modules created by me for fun using wonderful codes already existing. The original codes are from the following:

by Sung Kim in https://github.com/hunkim/,
and Aymeric Damien in https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/, and ... (TBL)

How have I been doing it? After execution to check it goes well without any errors, and, most importantly, without any total understanding, I just started refactoring the codes. What happened to me is just understanding the underling idea after for a while. Really easy to make some codes into structured COMMON framework and classes, and it's so fun! I believe it is the best way to get through the whole thing that we want to experience.
