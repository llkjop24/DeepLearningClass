# DeepLearningClass

Class modules created by Yung Byun for fun using wonderful codes already existing.
The original codes are from the following:

by Sung Kim in https://github.com/hunkim/,

by Aymeric Damien in https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/, and ... (TBL)

How have I been doing it? After execution to check it goes well without any errors,
and, most importantly, without any total understanding, I just started refactoring the codes.
What happened to me is just understanding the underling idea after for a while.
Really easy to make some codes into well structured COMMON framework and classes, and it's  so fun!

* Simple but (as a beginer) confusing 
* Good object-oriented language
